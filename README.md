# 2 body problem in Processing

Overview:

Coded for "Foundations of Programming" module, Foundation Year in Computing, Goldsmiths.
Attempt to simulate the 2 body problem using the Processing Library for Java.

Instructions:

Once run, yellow circle in the middle of the screen is a proposed body, stationary.
Upon a mouse click event, user picks location of the moving body.
Second mouse click event determines diameter.
Third mouse click determines speed and launches the body.

Currently diameter is simply aesthetic and will not affect the body's movement.

Info box in the lower right corner displays basic info.

Thoughts:

Project will not be updated further. I feel like it has more value in cataloguing my personal progress.
First attempt at coding with Classes and Objects.
